Deploying community-scale solar microgrids transforms rural livelihoods by powering water pumps and irrigation systems. Arrays of solar panels feed DC water pumps, allowing farmers to irrigate fields without diesel generators. This shift lowers operating costs and eliminates fuel transport challenges in remote areas. Community cooperatives manage the microgrid, collecting small fees for maintenance and battery replacement. Improved water access boosts crop yields and food security, demonstrating how solar infrastructure underpins sustainable rural development.

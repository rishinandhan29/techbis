A tree is a large, perennial plant with a single woody stem (trunk) supporting branches and leaves. It plays a critical role in the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide, releasing oxygen through photosynthesis, preventing soil erosion, and providing habitat for wildlife. Trees also offer shade, improve air quality, and contribute to the natural beauty of landscapes. They are essential to ecological balance and human well-being.

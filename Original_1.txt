Rural communities in arid regions benefit greatly from off-grid solar home systems. Small photovoltaic panels mounted on rooftops provide reliable lighting after sunset, enabling students to study and families to extend productive hours. Local micro-entrepreneurs use solar lanterns to power mobile charging stations, generating supplemental income. Government programs often include training workshops so villagers can maintain panels and batteries, reducing downtime. Over time, solar electrification decreases reliance on kerosene lamps, cutting indoor air pollution and health risks for women and children.
